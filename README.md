# Analyzing Statistical Research Papers: SAR and CAR Models

## Breif Overview

This report outlines a strong process for reading, annotating, and understanding statistical research papers that may be complex or difficult to understand. For an application of this process, this report references and thouroughly breaks down the paper “A close look at the spatial structure implied by the CAR and SAR models” by Melanie M. Wall (2002), which examines spatial dependence
structures in CAR and SAR models.

## Below are the main concepts covered in the report

1. The 3 Phases of Reading a research paper: Breif Overview, Annotation and Verification, and Final Overview
2. Breakdown of SAR and CAR statistical models: distribution assumptions, spatial dependence, simulataneous and conditional differences.
3. Spatial Correlation Matrices and Random Variables
4. Model Comaprision of SAR, CAR, Exponential Variogram, and IID models for spatial data.
5. Breakdown of the unpredictablilites of the spatial correlation structure in the SAR and CAR models, by evaluating spatial correlation parameters at different pre-established values, and the effects on model prediction.
